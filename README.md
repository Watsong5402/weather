Directions:
・Don't cheat
・Only view first minute of video: youtube.com/watch?v=iILFBGm_I9M
・Make a SPA that errors out if bad input but shows open weather data in a friendly view

Introduction:

The purpose of this project is to explore and understand flex-containers to display data in a 400x600 px UI that uses data from OpenWeatherMap.org.

Next Steps:

Rewrite with useState or useReducer. Data being taken from OpenWeatherMap does not query and refresh in real time. The source must be editted for each Http Response.
